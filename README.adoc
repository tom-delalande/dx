= dx

`dx` is a tool that aims to make development more consistent when working on multiple projects. It is a CLI tool that provides utilities to make the developer experience more enjoyable.

Currently, the only command is `doctor` which can be used to check whether the currently installed dependencies match what the repository expects you to have installed.

`dx` uses a `pkl` file named `dx.pkl` at the root of the repository to identify.

Here is an example `dx.pkl` file that can be used in a Java project.

doctor {
  new {
    name = "Java"
    command = "java --version"
    expectOutputContains = "openjdk 19.0.2 2023-01-17"
  }

  new {
    name = "Gradle"
    command = "gradle --version"
    expectOutputContains = "Gradle 8.3"
  }

  new {
    name = "Kotlin"
    command = "gradle --version"
    expectOutputContains = "Kotlin:       1.9.0"
  }
}
